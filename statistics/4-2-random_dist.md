[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

>> 
# 4-2 Random Dist

Exercise 2   *The numbers generated by random.random are supposed to be uniform between 0 and 1; that is, every value in the range should have the same probability.*

*Generate 1000 numbers from random.random and plot their PMF and CDF. Is the distribution uniform?*

Answer: We can test the distribution using PMF or CDF Function, after we have generated a sequence of 1000 random numbers.  As you can see from the images below, CDF was the best option to evalvuate the randomness 

```python
import thinkstats2
import thinkplot
import nsfg
import numpy as np

preg = nsfg.ReadFemPreg()
live = preg[preg.outcome == 2222221]

firsts = live[live.birthord == 1]
others = live[live.birthord != 1]


t = np.random.random(1000)

pmf = thinkstats2.Pmf(t)
thinkplot.Pmf(pmf, linewidth=0.1)
thinkplot.Config(xlabel='Random variate', ylabel='PMF')
thinkplot.show()

cdf = thinkstats2.Cdf(t)
thinkplot.Cdf(cdf)
thinkplot.Config(xlabel='Random variate', ylabel='CDF')
thinkplot.show()

```
