# Install software on your computer


### Install [git](http://git-scm.com/).

You have it installed if you can run `git --version` at the command
line and get output like `git version 2.13.5`.

Macbooks have git pre-installed.


### Install [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads).

There are two things you can verify to check your install.

First, from the command line, all of the following should start up
some kind of Python interpreter:

```bash
python3
ipython3
jupyter notebook
spyder
```

Second, inside any of those Python interpreters, you should be able to
do all of these without error:

```python
import numpy
import scipy
import matplotlib
import pandas
import statsmodels
import sklearn
```

### Install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) on Mac _(optional)_

For users who are already familiar with package managers, you may prefer to install Homebrew.

However, this is completely optional as Anaconda is an all-in-one package manager.

### Q1. Python Version 2 or 3

**Course material for the bootcamp is compatible with Python versions 2.7 and 3.0. All HackerRank Python pre-work is configured for Python 3 only.  Therefore, Python 3 is the recommended version.**  

Did you install Python 2 or 3? Why?  

>> I have installed 3 because all the libraries that were recommened for the course are avaiable in python 3. Also, some syntax is different for both versions but the changes are minor. Majority of the code I have encountered online is formatted for python 3. 

### Q2. Which Python Version because 

In the Terminal:

`python3 --version`

>> Python 3.6.3 :: Anaconda custom (64-bit)
